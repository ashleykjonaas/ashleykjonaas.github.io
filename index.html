<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<p>I started this repository July 28, 2018. I plan to eventually use this page as a sandbox to build my own website from scratch. On it, I would like to write code to install my trip cost calculator, currently sitting on my desktop in Excel format. With some effort, I am sure I can make it into a more robust tool that can scrape websites like GasBuddy and Google Maps to run calculations based off locations rather than various manual inputs (distance, $/L or $/gal, exchange rate).
</p>
<p>In the meantime, I invite you to consult <a href="https://ashleykjonaas.site123.me/">my prebuilt website</a>.
