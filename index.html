<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<p>I started this repository July 28, 2018. I plan to eventually use this page as a sandbox to build my own website from scratch. On it, I would like to eventually use code to install my personal trip cost calculator, currently in Excel format. With some effort, I am sure I can make it into a more robust tool that can scrape websites like GasBuddy and Google Maps to run calculations based off locations rather than various manual inputs (distance, $/L or $/gal, exchange rate).

<p>In the meantime, I invite you to consult my prebuilt website at <a html="https://ashleykjonaas.site123.me/">Site123</a>
